To  
The Principal,
Alizium Public School,
Lodhran, 

Subject: Request for Scheduling Mathematics Lecture in the First Five Periods

Respected Principle,

With due respect I state that I am writing to you on behalf of my classmates to kindly request a change in the scheduling of our Mathematics lecture.

Currently, our Mathematics lecture is scheduled during the last period of the day. As students, we find it challenging to concentrate and absorb the lessons effectively during this time. After a long day of various subjects and activities, our energy levels and attention spans tend to diminish significantly by the last period. This makes it difficult for us to fully engage with the complexities of Mathematics, a subject that requires high levels of concentration and mental alertness.

We believe that scheduling our Mathematics lecture within the first five periods would be highly beneficial. During the earlier part of the day, our minds are fresher, and we are more attentive and capable of grasping difficult concepts. This change would undoubtedly enhance our understanding and performance in the subject.

We kindly request you to consider this adjustment in our timetable. We are confident that this change will lead to an improved learning experience and better academic outcomes for all students involved.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. We are hopeful for a positive response.

Yours sincerely,

10th
B-3
